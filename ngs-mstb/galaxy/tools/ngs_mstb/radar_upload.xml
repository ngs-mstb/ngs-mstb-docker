        What it does
        ============

        Uploads extracted genes or other consensus sequences into RADAR along with the captured provenance data.

        RADAR serves as the secure System Of Record as well as the environment for
        the downstream analysis of variation between consensus sequences.

        The user name used to login into Galaxy will be used as the RADAR user name for the upload.
        It must already exist in RADAR.

        The timestamp should be assigned by the operator in order to label different assembly versions of the same
        study code.
