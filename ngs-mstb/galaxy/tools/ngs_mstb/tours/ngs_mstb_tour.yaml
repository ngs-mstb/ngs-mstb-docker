    - title: "<b>Scenario</b>"
      content: "We have eight Illumina NGS sequencing  datasets generated from two Respiratory Syncytial Virus samples. One sample contains RSV genome of subtype A, and another - of subtype B. Each sample was subject to four independent amplification and sequencing reactions . The amplification used four overlapping pairs of primers for each subtype in order
      to cover the entire RSV genome.<br>
      Each sample was also previously sequenced on a Sanger platform. 
      We have a single Sanger-derived contig for each sample covering the
      entire genome. We will assemble 
      each NGS dataset. In a follow-up interactive tour, we will compare the resulting consensus contigs with the corresponding Sanger contigs."

                <b>Assemble all eight NGS datasets</b>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Step 1: Download two FASTA files, each with both RSV A and B full genome sequences, to your computer and then upload the files into Galaxy. The sequences in one file will be used as references to recruit reads, and the sequences in another file with Sanger-drived contigs will be used to align the final assembly contigs for QC</li>
                   <li>Step 2: Use the first reference FASTA to build Ariba reference pack</li>
                   <li>Step 3: Build manifest listing paths to NGS FASTQ files and sample IDs. The FASTQ files are distributed 
                   with NGS-MSTB.</li>
                   <li>Step 4: Run the extraction tool on the FASTQ manifest to assemble NGS reads into consensus FASTA contigs recruiting against Ariba reference pack and generate a Web report with
                   final NGS contigs aligned against Sanger contigs.</li>

      Sanger references, we will use the Sanger FASTA as common QC reference in the Web report. To demonstrate that the assembly is not sensitive to the choice of recruiting references, we use a FASTA file with RSV A and B genomes selected at random from the NCBI.<br>
