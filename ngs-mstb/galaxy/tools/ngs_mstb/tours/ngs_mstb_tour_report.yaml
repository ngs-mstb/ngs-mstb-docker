                Please read and follow the instructions in each popup window before clicking <b>'Next'</b>.

                Click <b>'Prev'</b> in case you missed performing the necessary actions during any step.
                Check that the mouse pointer is in fact over the button you need before clicking, as the
                popup window shifts between steps."

    - title: "<b>Scenario</b>"
      content: "We have previously executed the assembly of eight Illumina NGS sequencing  datasets generated from two Respiratory Syncytial Virus samples. One sample contains RSV genome of subtype A, and another - of subtype B. Each sample was subject to four independent amplification and sequencing reactions . The amplification used four overlapping pairs of primers for each subtype in order
      to cover the entire RSV genome. We have assembled 
      each NGS dataset.<br>
      Each sample was also previously sequenced on a Sanger platform. 
      We have a single Sanger-derived contig for each sample covering the
      entire genome.  Now we will look at the resulting Web report and compare the NGS consensus contigs with the corresponding Sanger contigs."

    - title: "<b>Overview</b>"
      content: "We will go through the following:<br>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Step 1: Navigate to the Web report for the assembly</li>
                   <li>Step 2: Look at the mapping of the consensus contigs for all datasets to Sanger contigs</li>
                   <li>Step 3: Explore other aspects of the Web report</li>

    - title: "<b>Step 1: Navigate to the Web report for the assembly</b>"
      element: "#right .unified-panel-footer"
      content: "You can proceed under one of the two <b>alternative</b> scenarios:<br>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Option 1</b>. You have previously went through the tour of using 
      NGS-MSTB tools, executed the <b>Extract target genes...</b> tool and waited for the job
      to complete. In that case, you should already have a finished (colored
      green) dataset named <b>Diagnostic Web report...</b> at the top of your history panel on the right side of the Galaxy window.<br>
      To inspect the results, click on the <b>eye icon</b> next to the dataset name.
      </li>
      <li><b>Option 2</b>. You do not want to wait for the assembly to run. You just want to look
      at the output report. In that case, you can click on this link to the 
      <b><a href=\"/static/example_out/rsv-wg-vs-sanger/browser_contigs.html\" target=\"galaxy_main\">report that we computed</a> previously</b>.
      </li>
      </ul>
      In either case, after clicking as instructed, you should see in the central Galaxy panel eight rows of the output manifest
      describing assembly metrics for the final contigs. 
      If you are looking at the outputs of your own tour of the NGS-MSTB tools and you opted for the more restrictive wildcard in the Step 2 of that tour, you will see two rows of metrics.<br>
      <i>Tip</i>: when looking 
      at your own output reports outside of this interactive tour, you can instead
      right-click on the <b>eye icon</b> and open the <b>'Web report...'</b> in the new browser tab in order to use the full width of the browser window."

    - title: "<b>Step 2: Look at the mapping of the consensus contigs for all datasets to Sanger contigs</b>"
      element: "#right .unified-panel-footer"
      content: "In the Web report window, click on the tab <b>Sequences</b>,
      and repeatedly select in the <b>ref</b> field pull-down either RSVA or RSVB Sanger contigs as the
      genome browser references. For both RSV subtypes, you should see
      four NGS assembled contigs aligned to the Sanger references over the
      full 15.2 Kbp length of the RSV genome without any variation. This
      will mean that the NGS assemblies are identical to the Sanger-derived
      assemblies (possibly with compatible ambiguous nucleotide bases)."

    - title: "<b>Step 3: Explore other aspects of the Web report</b>"
      element: "#right .unified-panel-footer"
      content: "Further explore the functionality of the Web report by clicking on various tabs and following the help tips at the top of
      each tab window.<br>
      <b>Note</b>: when looking at the reads mapped to either
      assembly or reference, please keep in mind that the references shown are
      the best matching recruiting references, which were the unrelated RSV genomes from the
      NCBI rather than the Sanger contigs. Therefore, you will see variations relative to these NCBI references. If you want to explore the differences
      with the Sanger contigs at the read level, you can rerun the assembly by
      following the steps in the <i>using NGS-MSTB tools</i> tour but providing
      Sanger contigs as both recruiting (Prepare Ariba reference pack tool) and common QC references (Extract target genes tool)."
